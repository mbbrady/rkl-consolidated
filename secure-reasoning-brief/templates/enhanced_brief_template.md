## About This Brief

This automated brief monitors cutting-edge research in **secure reasoning** - the practice of building AI systems with auditable, verifiable, and trustworthy decision-making processes.

**What makes this brief unique:**
- ✅ **Hybrid AI curation** - Ollama (local) for summarization + Gemini (cloud) for expert analysis
- ✅ **Original secure reasoning analysis** - Not just summarizing papers, but explaining why they matter
- ✅ **Practitioner focus** - Clear implications for organizations building trustworthy AI
- ✅ **Fully automated** - Runs 2x daily with Phase-0 research telemetry
- ✅ **Expert filtering** - Each article evaluated for relevance to secure reasoning themes

**Secure reasoning encompasses:**
- 🔍 **Reasoning provenance** - Can we trace how conclusions were reached?
- ✓ **Auditability** - Can external parties verify reasoning steps?
- 💡 **Interpretability** - Can humans understand the reasoning process?
- 🎯 **Alignment** - Does reasoning align with human values/intentions?
- ✔️ **Verification** - Can reasoning be formally or empirically validated?
- 📋 **Governance** - Does it support AI oversight and accountability?
