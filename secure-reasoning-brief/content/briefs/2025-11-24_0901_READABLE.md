*Generated by Ollama (llama3.2:3b)*

Here are the technical summaries for each section:

**Main Contribution**
The paper addresses a critical issue in multilingual text-to-image (T2I) models, where outputs vary across cultural contexts due to language carrying cultural connotations, resulting in culturally neutral or English-biased results.

**Key Methodology**
The authors propose two complementary alignment strategies: inference-time cultural activation and layer-targeted cultural enhancement, which localize culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in fixed layers and update only culturally relevant layers.

**Most Important Result**
Current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts due to insufficient activation of culture-related representations, which can be addressed by amplifying identified neurons during inference-time cultural activation.

Here's a 80-word technical summary focusing on what practitioners need to know:

"Practitioners should be aware that current T2I models may produce culturally biased outputs under multilingual prompts. To address this issue, model developers can employ two complementary alignment strategies: (1) amplifying identified culture-sensitive neurons during inference-time activation or (2) updating only culturally relevant layers through layer-targeted enhancement. This allows for more consistent cultural consistency while preserving visual realism and semantic alignment in T2I models."

To mitigate this risk, consider implementing probing methods and alignment strategies that actively engage with culture-related representations, such as inference-time cultural activation or layer-targeted cultural enhancement. This can help ensure more consistent and accurate outputs across diverse cultural contexts.
