**Technical Summary (80 words)**

Practitioners should know that this paper proposes a new syntropic framework for AI alignment, which reconceives agent design through process-based mechanisms rather than encoding fixed human values. The key methodology involves using an information-theoretic framework to understand multi-agent alignment dynamics, with a focus on "syntropy" – the reduction of mutual uncertainty between agents through state alignment. The most important result is the proposed distinction between genuine and simulated moral capacity, which offers operational criteria for evaluating artificial systems' value emergence and moral agency.

### 💡 What This Means for Organizations

*Generated by Ollama (llama3.2:3b)*

Organizations adopting AI systems can focus on designing process-based, multi-agent mechanisms to achieve alignment through syntropy, rather than relying solely on encoding fixed human values into the system, reducing the risk of being trapped by value pluralism and the specification trap. This approach offers a potential opportunity for developing more adaptive and responsive AI systems that can learn from mutual uncertainty between agents. By adopting this framework, organizations can create a foundation for building morally capable and autonomous AI systems.
