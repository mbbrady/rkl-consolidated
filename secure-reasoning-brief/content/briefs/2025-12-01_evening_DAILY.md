## Must Read Papers

*   **Aligning Artificial Superintelligence via a Multi-Box Protocol:** This paper proposes a novel protocol for aligning artificial superintelligence (ASI) through mutual verification among isolated ASIs. It matters because it reduces reliance on a single point of failure in alignment. The protocol offers a decentralized approach to AI alignment by leveraging peer verification among isolated ASIs. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21779)
*   **Medical Malice: A Dataset for Context-Aware Safety in Healthcare LLMs:** This paper introduces a dataset of adversarial prompts calibrated to capture context-dependent violations in healthcare LLMs. This is crucial because it shifts the focus from generic safety measures to context-aware safety. Practitioners should use this dataset to evaluate and improve the safety of healthcare LLMs in specific contexts. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21757](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21757)
