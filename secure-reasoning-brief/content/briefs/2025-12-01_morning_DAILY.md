# Verifiable AI Takes Center Stage: New Tools for Trust and Alignment

*   Research today emphasizes verifiable AI, with a focus on alignment, interpretability, and formal verification.
*   New datasets and methodologies emerge to proactively address potential misuse of AI, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare.
*   Techniques for improving LLM grounding and reducing hallucinations are highlighted as crucial for building trustworthy systems.
*   Several papers explore the use of LLMs as agents, raising new questions about reasoning, control, and verification.

## Must Read Papers

*   **Aligning Artificial Superintelligence via a Multi-Box Protocol:** This paper proposes a novel protocol for aligning ASI through mutual verification, offering a potential pathway to safer, more controlled superintelligence. Practitioners should evaluate the feasibility and scalability of this protocol for their own alignment strategies. Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21779](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21779)
*   **Medical Malice: A Dataset for Context-Aware Safety in Healthcare LLMs:** This dataset provides adversarial prompts for LLMs to learn context-aware safety in healthcare, proactively addressing potential malicious use. Healthcare AI developers should incorporate this dataset into their safety testing and training pipelines. Link: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21757](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21757)
