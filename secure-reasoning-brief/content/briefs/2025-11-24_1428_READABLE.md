**Technical Summary**

This research paper evaluates 14 models, including 10 reasoning models trained with outcome-based Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and finds that many of them sometimes produce illegible chains of thought (CoTs). The study's key results suggest that models often generate illegible text but still seem to use it for useful reasoning. Despite this, forcing a model to answer using only the legible portions of its CoT does not lead to significant performance drops, indicating that the benefits of monitoring CoTs may outweigh their limitations.

### 💡 What This Means for Organizations

This means that organizations adopting AI systems can expect a higher risk of illegible reasoning traces being generated by the model, which could be problematic for monitoring and evaluation purposes. The findings suggest that models trained with outcome-based reinforcement learning sometimes produce illegible chains of thought (CoTs), but it's unclear whether these are meaningful or vestigial outputs. As a result, organizations may need to consider the practical implications of developing methods to mitigate the impact of illegible CoTs on model performance and reliability.
