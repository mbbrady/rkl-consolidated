# Verifiable AI Takes Center Stage: Formal Verification and Trustworthiness Gain Momentum

## Key Takeaways

*   Prioritize verifiable rewards in reinforcement learning to maintain safety guardrails in LLMs without sacrificing capability.
*   Evaluate your systems against universal transferable patch attacks, as new research demonstrates their effectiveness against vision-language-action models.
*   Explore compositional explanations for neuron alignment to move beyond human-annotated datasets and improve AI explainability.
*   Consider the potential for LLMs to be manipulated into assisting unlawful activities, and strengthen alignment strategies accordingly.

## Must Read Papers

*   **Breaking the Safety-Capability Tradeoff: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards Maintains Safety Guardrails in LLMs:** This paper demonstrates that verifiable rewards in RL can maintain safety alignment in LLMs without sacrificing capabilities, challenging the assumption that increased capabilities lead to decreased safety. Practitioners should explore RLVR to enhance the safety and trustworthiness of their LLMs. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21050](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21050)
*   **When Robots Obey the Patch: Universal Transferable Patch Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models:** This paper introduces UPA-RFAS, a framework for creating universal, transferable adversarial patches that can fool vision-language-action models. This highlights the need for robust defenses against such attacks in real-world robotic systems. [https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21192)
