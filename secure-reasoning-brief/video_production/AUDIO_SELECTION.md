# Audio Take Selection

**Created:** November 25, 2025
**Purpose:** Track which audio takes to use for final video assembly

## Audio Duration Summary

| Section | v1 Duration | v2 Duration | Target | Selected |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 01-opening | 104.7s | (only v1) | 50s | **v1** |
| 02-problem | 28.3s | 27.6s | 15s | **v2** (slightly faster) |
| 03-architecture | 23.7s | 22.8s | 25s | **v2** (closer to target) |
| 04-daily-brief | 19.0s | 17.1s | 20s | **v2** (closer to target) |
| 05-weekly-synthesis | 23.0s | 23.6s | 20s | **v1** (closer to target) |
| 06-telemetry | 22.0s | 21.2s | 25s | **v2** (slightly better) |
| 07-impact | 18.6s | 18.5s | 15s | **v2** (negligible diff) |
| 08-closing | 23.5s | 24.8s | 20s | **v1** (closer to target) |

**Total video duration (audio only):** ~245 seconds (4:05)

**Note:** Section 01 is much longer than target (104s vs 50s). This is acceptable - it's the introduction and sets up the entire project.

## Selected Takes for Video Assembly

```bash
01-opening_v1.wav          # 104.7s - only take available
02-problem_v2.wav          # 27.6s
03-architecture_v2.wav     # 22.8s
04-daily-brief_v2.wav      # 17.1s
05-weekly-synthesis_v1.wav # 23.0s
06-telemetry_v2.wav        # 21.2s
07-impact_v2.wav           # 18.5s
08-closing_v1.wav          # 23.5s
```

**Listen to selected takes and adjust if needed before final assembly.**

## Notes

- Opening section runs longer than planned (104s vs 50s target) - this is fine
- Most sections are close to or slightly over target durations
- Total runtime ~4 minutes - perfect for capstone demo video
- Can trim silence or speed up slightly in post if needed
