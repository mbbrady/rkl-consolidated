# Automated Blog System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a fully automated blog generation system where **Gemini writes the entire blog post** rather than just validating summaries.

---

## System Architecture

### Pipeline Flow

```
RSS Feeds → Ollama Summaries → Gemini Analysis → Gemini Blog Writing → 3 Output Formats
```

**Detailed steps:**

1. **Feed Monitoring** (Discovery agents)
   - ArXiv, AI Alignment Forum, Google AI Blog
   - Filters for secure reasoning relevance

2. **Content Summarization** (Ollama llama3.2:3b)
   - Technical summaries from abstracts/excerpts
   - Lay explanations for practitioners

3. **Expert Analysis** (Gemini 2.0-flash)
   - Quality validation (pass/fail/uncertain)
   - Secure reasoning relevance scoring (0-1)
   - Original analysis: key insights, practical value, significance
   - Recommendation: must-include/include/consider/exclude

4. **Blog Writing** (Gemini 2.0-flash)
   - Synthesizes all articles into cohesive narrative
   - Identifies themes and trends
   - Provides practitioner recommendations
   - Writes engaging introduction and conclusion

5. **Output Generation** (Automated)
   - JSON: Machine-readable with full metadata
   - READABLE.md: Human-readable structured format
   - BLOG.md: Gemini-written blog post

---

# Secure Reasoning Research Brief - November 20, 2025: Prioritizing Transparency and Pluralistic Values

Welcome to today's Secure Reasoning Research Brief. A significant trend we're
observing is a shift from simply improving AI *performance* to focusing on *how*
and *why* AI systems arrive at their conclusions, and whose values are being
reflected in those conclusions...

## Featured Articles

### 1. PathMind: A Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason Framework...

This paper proposes a significant improvement to how LLMs interact with
knowledge graphs...

**Why it matters for secure reasoning:** This is a game-changer for
interpretability. Instead of a black-box LLM spitting out an answer, PathMind
selectively highlights the *reasoning paths* it used to arrive at that answer...

**Practical implications:** Organizations using LLMs for knowledge-intensive
tasks should seriously consider integrating PathMind's approach...

## Themes and Trends Synthesis

The connecting thread across these papers is the increasing emphasis on
transparency, interpretability, and value alignment in AI development...

## Recommendations for Practitioners

1. **Prioritize Interpretability:** When designing and deploying AI systems...
2. **Embrace Diversity in Alignment:** Actively seek out and incorporate feedback...
3. **Develop Hybrid Evaluation Metrics:** Develop evaluation metrics that balance...

## Key Advantages

### 1. Gemini as Expert Writer (Not Just Validator)

**Before:**
```
Ollama: "Here's a summary"
Gemini: "Summary looks accurate ✓"
```

**After:**
```
Ollama: "Here's a summary"
Gemini (Analysis): "This tackles reasoning provenance through explicit path
tracking, addressing a critical gap in LLM auditability..."
Gemini (Blog): "Today we're seeing a significant trend toward transparency...
PathMind is a game-changer because..."
```

### 2. Value-Add at Every Stage

**Ollama (Local):**
- Technical summaries from abstracts
- Lay explanations for non-experts
- Cost-effective, privacy-preserving

**Gemini (Cloud):**
- Quality validation (catch hallucinations)
- Secure reasoning expertise (domain knowledge)
- Original analysis (why this matters)
- Expert writing (synthesis and narrative)

### 3. Three Audiences, Three Formats

| Audience | Format | Use Case |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Machines | JSON | API integration, data analysis |
| Researchers | READABLE.md | Quick review, internal sharing |
| Practitioners | BLOG.md | Public consumption, understanding |

## Automation Details

### Cron Schedule

```bash
# Run at 9 AM and 9 PM daily
0 9 * * * /path/to/cron_pipeline_wrapper.sh
0 21 * * * /path/to/cron_pipeline_wrapper.sh
```

### Pipeline Execution

```bash
# Activated conda environment: rkl-briefs
python scripts/fetch_and_summarize.py

# Automatically generates:
content/briefs/YYYY-MM-DD_articles.json      # JSON with Gemini analysis
content/briefs/YYYY-MM-DD_READABLE.md        # Structured markdown
content/briefs/YYYY-MM-DD_BLOG.md            # Gemini-written blog
```

### Error Handling

- **Ollama unavailable:** Pipeline fails early with clear error
- **Gemini unavailable:** Skips QA and blog, generates JSON + READABLE
- **Rate limiting:** Gracefully handles quota errors, continues pipeline
- **Empty summaries:** Validates and aborts before saving

---

## API Rate Limits

**Gemini Free Tier:**
- 15 requests/minute
- With 20 articles: 20 QA calls + 1 blog call = 21 calls/run
- **Mitigation:** Pipeline spaces out calls naturally (~2 seconds each)
- **Fallback:** Blog generation fails gracefully with warning

**Production Recommendation:**
- Upgrade to paid tier or batch processing
- Or reduce article count to stay under limit

---

## Competition Value

### Demonstration Points

1. **Sophisticated hybrid model** - Local LLM + cloud LLM with clear role separation
2. **Domain expertise integration** - Gemini acts as senior AI safety researcher
3. **Multiple output formats** - Machine-readable, human-readable, public-facing
4. **Original value creation** - Not just aggregation, but expert analysis and synthesis
5. **Production-ready** - Automated, error-handled, scheduled

### What Makes This Unique

**Not just:**
- RSS aggregator with summaries
- Content filter with tags
- Template-filled blog posts

**But rather:**
- Expert curator with domain knowledge
- Original analysis provider
- Professional writer synthesizing research
