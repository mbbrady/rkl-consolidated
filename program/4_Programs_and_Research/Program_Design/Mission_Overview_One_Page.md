**Mission**
Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL) develops **open, verifiable methods and reproducible infrastructure** that let **large-scale reasoning systems (like GPT and Claude) and locally hosted models** engage responsibly with **curated, governed knowledge domains**—without exposing or transferring data.
RKL provides tools that help organizations **select, curate, and govern which knowledge domains** to make accessible to reasoning systems—whether **peer-reviewed literature, institutional data, operational knowledge, or community experience**—maintaining full agency over what is exposed and how it can be used.

**Vision**
A world where every organization, practitioner, and community can reason with both its own knowledge and the most current, authoritative understanding in its field.
Reasoning systems bridge scientific evidence and lived experience to deliver trustworthy, up-to-date insights while keeping sensitive information under local control.

**Approach**
- **Protocols over platforms:** Open standards (e.g., MCP, RAG+) define secure AI–data interaction.
- **Natural-language reasoning:** Enables intuitive yet governed access to curated knowledge domains.
- **Decision support & research:** Applied pilots help organizations use existing knowledge; research partnerships study responsible co-creation.

**Program Areas**
1. Open Protocols for Contextual AI
2. Reference Implementations & Toolkits
3. Decision Support & Knowledge Access Pilots
4. Governance & Stewardship Frameworks
5. Research & Applied Inquiry
6. Education & Public Engagement

**Year 1 Focus (2025–2026)**
- **Closed RAG Reference Stack:** Reproducible, privacy-preserving context environment using RKL's independent computational infrastructure.
- **Field Pilot:** Real-world deployment and validation.
- **Governance Toolkit v1:** Templates for consent and policy-based access.

**Taglines**
- *Helping the world use what it already knows.*
- *Context in. Custody stays.*
- *Trusted reasoning for living knowledge.*
