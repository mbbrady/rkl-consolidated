# Resonant Knowledge Lab – Mission Overview

**Virginia 501(c)(3) Nonprofit (est. 2025)** | info@resonantknowledgelab.org | resonantknowledgelab.org

## Mission

RKL develops **open infrastructure** that lets **reasoning systems (GPT, Claude, local models)** engage with **curated, governed knowledge domains** without exposing data. We provide tools that help organizations **select and govern which knowledge** to make accessible—peer-reviewed literature, institutional data, operational knowledge, or community experience—maintaining **full agency** over what is exposed and how.

## Vision

A world where every organization can reason with both its own knowledge and current authoritative understanding in its field, bridging scientific evidence and lived experience while keeping sensitive information under local control.

## Approach

**Protocols over platforms:** Open standards (MCP, RAG+) define secure AI–data interaction | **Natural-language reasoning:** Governed access to curated domains | **Decision support & research:** Applied pilots + research partnerships

## Programs

**Open Protocols** – Apply MCP and RAG+ standards | **Reference Implementations** – Open-source adapters and on-prem stacks | **Pilots** – Real-world deployments (healthcare, archives, municipalities) | **Governance Frameworks** – Templates for consent and licensing | **Research** – NSF-funded partnerships | **Education** – Workshops and training

## Year 1 (2025–2026)

**MCP + Closed RAG Stack** – Privacy-preserving reference implementation | **Field Pilot** – Single-partner validation | **Governance Toolkit** – Templates for consent and access control

## Use Cases

**Healthcare:** Clinicians reasoning with EHR + research without PHI exposure | **Public Admin:** Cities using records without exposing sensitive data | **Archives:** Role-based access with consent controls | **Education:** Current verified knowledge access | **Environment:** Federated regional + local data

## Taglines

*Helping the world use what it already knows* | *Context in. Custody stays* | *Trusted reasoning for living knowledge*
