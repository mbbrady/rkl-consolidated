We have field reports for each Arctic project during each season. We would really enjoy having some story maps to link to our website relative to our projects.

We have so much content ( varying science datasets and multimedia) its hard to pull it together in an enjoyable accessible way for viewers on top of the general science and reporting deliverables.

Outside of our Arctic work we would like to find a GIS intern for our microplastic project coming up in the Chesapeake Bay to help us produce storymaps for that campaign

I understand! This is the website I need to update and add recent content relative to the project perhaps the story map. http://www.oceanresearchproject.org/programs/science/marine-debris/

There should be point and line files. Line files are the sampling transects the vessel conducted and their are some point sampling locations to.
I will have actual data that is associated with these sampling stations in a few weeks.

I also have a gis file that indicates the concentration of microplastic at all Chesapeake bay Report locations and a file that shows the the surface temperature, salinity and buoyancy.

We will have the second batch of data from the Plastic project in March.

I am asking some others on our team about integration with our wordpress website and will follow up
