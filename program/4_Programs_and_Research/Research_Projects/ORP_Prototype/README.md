# Resonant Knowledge Lab x Ocean Research Project Prototype

## Overview
This prototype demonstrates a secure, locally hosted AI + mapping interface
for querying marine plastics expedition data from the Ocean Research Project (ORP).

## Objectives
- Build a local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for expedition data
- Compare open-source vs API-based AI performance
- Generate an interactive map of sample sites (Leafmap / MapLibre)
- Produce a public-facing demo page under resonantknowledgelab.org/prototypes/orp

## Structure
- `data/`: raw and processed datasets (CSV, GeoJSON, shapefiles)
- `src/`: Python scripts and AI pipelines
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter experiments and visualizations
- `web/`: front-end demo assets
- `docs/`: proposal drafts, meeting notes, and partner materials
- `outputs/`: generated reports, logs, and figures
