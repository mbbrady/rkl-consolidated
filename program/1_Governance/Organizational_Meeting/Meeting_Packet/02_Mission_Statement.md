## 1. Mission

**Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL)** is a nonprofit research and development organization creating **open, verifiable methods and reproducible infrastructure** that enable **large-scale reasoning systems (like GPT and Claude) and locally hosted models** to engage responsibly with **curated, locally governed knowledge domains**—without exposing or transferring them.

RKL provides the tools and methods that help institutions, practitioners, and communities **select, curate, and govern which knowledge domains** to make accessible to reasoning systems—whether **peer-reviewed literature, state-of-the-art research, institutional data, operational knowledge, or community experience**—through **secure, natural-language interaction**.

Users maintain full agency over what knowledge is exposed, how it can be accessed, and under what governance terms—allowing reasoning systems to work with the specific combination of authoritative and contextual knowledge each organization requires.

Through applied research partnerships (e.g., NSF-funded projects), RKL also examines how these same architectures can foster **new forms of collective understanding**, studying when and how human–machine reasoning may responsibly contribute to knowledge creation and innovation.

## 2. Vision

We envision a world where **every organization, practitioner, and community can reason with both the knowledge it holds and the most current, authoritative understanding in its field.**

In this world, reasoning systems bridge scientific literature, professional standards, and community experience—making all forms of knowledge discoverable, verifiable, and usable through natural-language interaction.
Governance protocols ensure that sensitive or proprietary information remains under local control while enabling access to the latest, evidence-based insight.

RKL advances this transformation by developing the **trusted infrastructures and applied methods for responsible human–machine reasoning**—where discovery, performance, and innovation thrive within secure, auditable, and ethically governed contexts.

## 3. Guiding Principles

1. **Context Over Content** – Models engage with *knowledge context* through controlled interfaces, not raw data transfer.
2. **Protocols Over Platforms** – The trust layer of AI must remain open, inspectable, and non-proprietary.
3. **Verification Over Assumption** – Privacy, provenance, and consent must be provable, not implied.
4. **Governance by Design** – Human and organizational governance are encoded in the architecture itself.
5. **Resonance Through Reuse** – Knowledge gains value when it can be rediscovered and applied across time.
6. **Education Through Implementation** – Each pilot functions as both research and training.

## 4. Core Program Areas

| Program Area | Focus | Examples |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| **Open Protocols for Contextual AI** | Apply and refine public-interest protocols for verifiable AI–data interaction. | Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation; policy-aware retrieval architectures (RAG+). |
| **Reference Implementations & Toolkits** | Open-source adapters and sandboxes for secure AI integration. | MCP service nodes; audit logging systems; reproducible on-prem stacks. |
| **Decision Support & Knowledge Access Pilots** | Applied projects enabling natural-language reasoning within trusted data environments to uncover and use existing knowledge. | Healthcare copilots; municipal planning assistants; environmental data synthesis chat interfaces. |
| **Governance & Stewardship Frameworks** | Consent, data licenses, and governance templates for protocolized AI. | Community consent templates; institutional data-trust frameworks. |
| **Research & Applied Inquiry** | Aspirational research partnerships studying human–machine collaboration and co-knowledge creation. | NSF-funded experiments on reasoning within context; analysis of AI-supported organizational learning. |
| **Education & Public Engagement** | Capacity-building and training in ethical AI and knowledge governance. | Workshops, curricula, and red/blue-team privacy labs. |

## 5. Core Purpose

Modern organizations and societies produce vast and varied forms of knowledge—from peer-reviewed research to operational data and lived experience—but lack the means to **represent, govern, and connect them systematically** for responsible reasoning.
Practitioners often make critical decisions without access to either the most recent scientific evidence or the latent insights within their own institutions.

RKL was founded to close this gap by creating frameworks that make **all relevant knowledge—authoritative, local, and experiential—discoverable, verifiable, and machine-interpretable** within its rightful custodial boundaries.

These frameworks allow large-scale reasoning systems to **mediate between state-of-the-art research and contextual practice**, ensuring that the most current and trusted knowledge informs human judgment while remaining transparently governed.

## 6. Year 1 Operational Scope (2025 – 2026)

RKL's first year will emphasize focused, high-impact prototypes and partnerships that establish a technical and ethical foundation for future expansion.

| Priority | Activity | Rationale | Key Deliverable |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **1. MCP + Closed RAG Reference Stack** | Build and document a reproducible, privacy-preserving AI context environment using local compute. Includes establishing RKL's independent computational infrastructure (GPU nodes, secure networking, monitoring systems). | Demonstrates the mission in practice: "trust through protocol." Establishes foundation for all future research. | Open GitHub release of MCP + RAG reference implementation; operational compute environment. |
| **2. Field Pilot (Single Partner)** | Partner with one organization (e.g., archive, clinic, or municipality) to deploy and test the RKL stack in context. | Produces a public case study and early validation. | Pilot report + reproducible configuration documentation. |
| **3. Governance Toolkit v1** | Publish templates for consent, data licensing, and policy-based access. | Bridges technical and institutional audiences; directly fundable. | "AI Governance Starter Kit" (PDF + Markdown release). |

These activities provide tangible outcomes for initial funders and establish the basis for future programs such as multi-site pilots, fellowships, and the Public-Interest Compute Consortium.

## 7. Illustrative Use Cases

| Sector | Problem | RKL Approach | Outcome |
|--------|----------|--------------|----------|
| **Healthcare** | Clinicians need large-scale reasoning (GPT/Claude-level) without PHI exposure. | MCP-based gateway to EHR; scoped retrieval; on-prem auditing; integration of peer-reviewed sources. | Clinical reasoning with zero PHI egress; access to up-to-date best practices. |
| **Public Administration** | Cities and other municipal components must triage records and use historic data for planning. | Policy-aware retrieval + auto-redaction adapters; context synthesis. | Faster decisions; better situational awareness from existing records for more authoritative decisions. |
| **Cultural Heritage** | Archives and communities need role-based access and consent controls. | Role-gated RAGs and policy bundles. | Data sovereignty preserved; cross-community insight enabled. |
| **Education & Research** | Teachers and scientists need current, verified knowledge beyond static materials. | Context brokers linking institutional repositories with large-scale reasoning tools. | Continuous, auditable knowledge updates; improved research and pedagogy. |
| **Environmental Management** | Local and regional groups hold distributed data on land-use or impacts. | Federated RAG integrating local observations with regional models. | Informed policy; local voices visible in decision processes. |

## 8. Organizational Role

RKL serves as a **neutral implementer and researcher** applying existing standards and developing practical infrastructure—maintaining the public-interest layer that connects organizational and community knowledge with artificial reasoning systems.

We collaborate with open-source communities, research institutions, and public agencies to prototype, test, and validate trustworthy methods for AI interaction. As our work matures, we may contribute to emerging standards bodies, but initially focus on **applying and refining existing protocols** (like MCP) rather than creating new standards from scratch.

**RKL develops and maintains independent computational infrastructure** to support open, auditable, and public-interest AI research—ensuring that experiments are reproducible, data remains secure, and operations are transparent.
