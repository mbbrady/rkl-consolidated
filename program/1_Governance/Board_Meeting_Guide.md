## For IRS and Legal Compliance

The IRS and legal authorities may review your minutes. Ensure they show:

✅ **Conflict of Interest** - Board members disclose conflicts and recuse themselves from relevant votes
✅ **Compensation Decisions** - If paying staff, document comparability data and independent approval
✅ **Major Decisions** - Property purchases, large contracts, policy changes
✅ **Mission Alignment** - Decisions advance the charitable mission
✅ **Quorum** - Enough board members present to make valid decisions
