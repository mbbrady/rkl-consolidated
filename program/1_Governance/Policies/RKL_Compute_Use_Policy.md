# Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL) – Compute Use Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Approved by:** Board of Directors
**Effective Date:** [TBD - Pending Organizational Meeting]

## 1. Purpose

Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL) maintains and develops local and distributed computing infrastructure ("RKL Compute") to advance its nonprofit mission: enabling open, verifiable, and secure methods for ethical artificial intelligence research and public-interest applications.

RKL Compute resources—including on-premise servers, GPUs, cloud nodes, and storage—exist solely to support mission-aligned research, experimentation, and education.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Public Benefit:** All computational resources are used in service of RKL's exempt, charitable, and educational purposes.
- **Transparency:** Hardware acquisition, funding sources, and usage are documented and available for board review.
- **Data Ethics:** Only publicly shareable, de-identified, or appropriately licensed datasets are stored or processed.
- **Security:** Systems are configured to protect research integrity and user privacy.
- **Fair Access:** Access is granted based on project relevance, available capacity, and adherence to this policy.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Hardware selection prioritizes performance-per-watt and renewable energy sources where available.

## 3. Permitted Uses

RKL Compute may be used for:

- Developing, testing, and evaluating open-source AI frameworks (e.g., RAG, MCP).
- Processing datasets that contribute to RKL's public-interest research.
- Hosting prototypes, demonstrations, or educational resources under RKL projects.
- Training or fine-tuning models using datasets for which RKL has appropriate rights.
- Conducting reproducible experiments for grant-funded research projects.
- Providing computational resources for approved pilot deployments and field studies.

## 4. Prohibited Uses

RKL Compute may **not** be used for:

- Personal commercial ventures or private consulting work.
- Storage or processing of restricted government data, classified information, or controlled unclassified information (CUI) without appropriate authorization and infrastructure.
- Cryptocurrency mining, personal cloud hosting, or unrelated entertainment activity.
- Work conducted under an employee's official federal capacity or during paid government time.
- Any activity that could jeopardize RKL's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.
- Processing of data in violation of applicable privacy laws or ethical research standards.

## 5. Governance and Oversight

- The **Executive Director** or delegated **Infrastructure Lead** maintains usage logs and access credentials.
- The **Board of Directors** reviews compute utilization annually for mission alignment.
- Any conflicts of interest or resource misuse must be reported to the Board for resolution.
- Quarterly usage summaries are provided to the Board showing:
  - Active projects and collaborators
  - Resource allocation by project type
  - Energy consumption and costs
  - Security incidents (if any)

## 6. Collaborator Access

Collaborators—including federal, academic, or independent researchers—may use RKL Compute in a **personal, voluntary capacity** under a written collaboration agreement that:

- Confirms personal-capacity participation (not in official government capacity).
- Prohibits use of restricted, classified, or government-proprietary data.
- Includes appropriate disclaimers of agency endorsement.
- Specifies scope of access, duration, and project deliverables.
- Requires use of personally owned equipment for remote access; no government-furnished equipment may be used unless explicitly approved in writing by RKL and the collaborator's agency ethics office.

All collaboration agreements must be reviewed and approved by the Executive Director and documented in RKL's collaboration register.

## 7. Funding and Ownership

All compute resources are owned or leased by RKL, funded through grants, donations, or earned income.
They remain property of the nonprofit and are dedicated exclusively to RKL's exempt purposes.

Equipment is tracked as capital assets and depreciated according to standard accounting practices. Energy and maintenance costs are documented as research infrastructure expenses.

## 8. Transparency

A summary of compute assets, funding sources, and major projects will be published annually on RKL's website as part of the **"Infrastructure Transparency Report."**

The report will include:
- Inventory of compute hardware (make, model, capacity)
- Funding sources for acquisition and operation
- Major projects and research outcomes
- Energy consumption and sustainability metrics
- Anonymized usage statistics

## 9. Data Governance

All data stored or processed on RKL Compute must:
- Have documented provenance and licensing
- Comply with applicable privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Be approved by the Infrastructure Lead or Executive Director
- Include data retention and destruction policies

Sensitive or community-governed data requires additional review and may necessitate:
- Specific access controls and encryption
- Community consent agreements
- Independent ethics review

## 10. Security Requirements

RKL Compute infrastructure must:
- Use strong authentication (SSH keys, multi-factor authentication)
- Maintain regular security updates and patches
- Implement network segmentation and firewalls
- Log all access and system changes
- Conduct regular security audits
- Have documented incident response procedures

## 11. Amendment Process

This policy may be amended by majority vote of the Board of Directors. All amendments will be documented with version numbers and effective dates.

Users will be notified of policy changes and must acknowledge updated terms before continued access is granted.
