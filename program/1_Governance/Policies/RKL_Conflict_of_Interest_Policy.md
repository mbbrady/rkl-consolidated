CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST POLICY
OF
RESONANT KNOWLEDGE LAB

1. Purpose

The purpose of this Conflict-of-Interest Policy is to protect the interests of Resonant Knowledge Lab (the “Corporation”) when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of a director, officer, or key person, or might result in an excess benefit transaction under applicable IRS regulations.

2. Covered Persons

This Policy applies to all members of the Board of Directors, officers, and any key persons identified by the Board as having significant influence over the affairs of the Corporation (“Covered Persons”).

3. Definition of Conflict of Interest

A conflict of interest arises when a Covered Person has a direct or indirect financial interest in a transaction or arrangement involving the Corporation, or when the Covered Person’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation may be compromised by a competing interest or obligation.

A “financial interest” exists if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:
- An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement;
- A compensation arrangement with the Corporation or with any entity with which the Corporation has a transaction or arrangement; or
- A potential ownership, investment, or compensation interest in any entity or transaction under consideration by the Corporation.

4. Duty to Disclose

A Covered Person must disclose the existence and nature of any actual or potential conflict of interest to the Board of Directors (or a designated committee) prior to the Corporation entering into the proposed transaction or arrangement.

5. Procedure for Addressing Conflicts

a. The Covered Person may make a presentation to the Board, but shall leave the meeting during discussion and voting on the matter giving rise to the conflict.

b. The remaining disinterested directors shall determine whether a conflict of interest exists.

c. If a conflict is determined to exist, the Board shall:
   - Exercise due diligence to determine whether the Corporation can obtain a more advantageous transaction or arrangement with reasonable efforts under the circumstances that would not give rise to a conflict; and
   - If no more advantageous alternative is reasonably possible, determine by majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the Corporation’s best interest, for its own benefit, and fair and reasonable.

6. Records of Proceedings

The minutes of the Board and any relevant committees shall document:
- The names of the persons who disclosed or were found to have a conflict;
- The nature of the conflict;
- Any alternatives considered; and
- The Board’s decision and rationale.

7. Compensation Matters

A voting member of the Board who receives compensation from the Corporation for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member’s compensation.

Federal employees shall not receive any compensation from the Corporation while they are federal employees, as provided in the Corporation’s Bylaws.

8. Annual Statements

Each Covered Person shall annually sign a statement affirming that they:
- Have received and read this Policy;
- Understand the Policy; and
- Agree to comply with the Policy and disclose conflicts as required.

9. Periodic Reviews

The Board shall conduct periodic reviews to ensure that the Corporation does not engage in transactions or arrangements that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status.

10. Acknowledgment

By serving the Corporation, each Covered Person agrees to abide by this Policy and to act at all times in the best interests of the Corporation and its charitable, educational, and scientific purposes.
