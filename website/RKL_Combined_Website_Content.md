# About Resonant Knowledge Lab

**Tagline:** *Secure reasoning. Local control.*

Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL) is a nonprofit research and implementation organization building open, verifiable methods that enable people and institutions to engage AI reasoning systems with their own knowledge—without transferring control or custody.

---

## Vision

RKL envisions a world where knowledge flows securely and ethically—where data remain under the care of those who steward them, yet the insights they contain can travel freely for collective good.

> **When governance ensures collective benefit, authority to control, responsibility, and ethics, data can finally become FAIR—findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable—without compromising sovereignty or trust.**

While FAIR remains useful for organizations that choose to publish or share openly, RKL's core work focuses on **secure reasoning under local governance**.
Our aim is not to make all data open—but to make all reasoning accountable, auditable, and under the control of those who hold the knowledge.

Much of the world's most valuable knowledge is silent—not because it lacks importance, but because we lack the governance capacity to use it safely.
**Weak governance, not sensitivity itself, keeps knowledge locked away.**

RKL's frameworks strengthen that governance, turning protection into participation and silos into resonance.
By embedding ethical rules directly into data and reasoning systems, RKL makes **trust the medium of discovery.**

---

## Mission

To develop open, verifiable frameworks that enable people and institutions to use advanced reasoning systems—like frontier AI—**responsibly, transparently, and under their own control.**

RKL's work bridges technical interoperability with ethical governance so that reasoning systems respect the rights, dignity, and contexts of the knowledge they use.

---

## Guiding Principles

These principles translate RKL's philosophy into system design choices, expressing how **CARE governs secure reasoning** in practice.

- **Context Over Content** – Reasoning systems engage through controlled context, not raw data transfer.
- **Governance by Design** – Ethical authority and consent are built into the architecture itself.
- **Verification Over Assumption** – Provenance, privacy, and consent must be provable, not implied.
- **Protocols Over Platforms** – The trust layer of AI must remain open, inspectable, and non-proprietary.
- **Resonance Through Responsible Reuse** – Knowledge gains value when it can be ethically rediscovered, derived, and applied across contexts under local governance.

---

## Modes of Practice

RKL supports three complementary modes of secure reasoning and data stewardship:

| Type | Mode | Purpose |
|------|------|----------|
| **I. CARE-Focused** | Secure reasoning within local systems. | Protect and govern sensitive knowledge. |
| **II. Open Knowledge Sharing** | Public or collaborative knowledge with ethical guardrails. | Communicate and collaborate transparently when openness is the goal. |
| **III. CARE-Enabled Insight Exchange** | Derived insight sharing without exposing raw data. | Transform decision-making by unlocking trustworthy knowledge once too protected to use. |

Type III represents RKL's north star—**a world where local control and global understanding coexist.**

> **In practice, most organizations span more than one mode.**
> Different categories of data, information, or knowledge may fall under different types depending on their purpose, sensitivity, and intended audience.
> RKL's frameworks are designed to accommodate this mix—allowing each dataset or knowledge domain to be governed according to its own objectives while remaining interoperable through shared ethical and technical standards.

For detailed technical implementation, see our [Methods](/methods/) page.

---

## Approach

RKL's frameworks combine:

- **Ethical Governance** – CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) guide every decision.
- **Secure Reasoning Infrastructure** – Implemented through the *Model Context Protocol (MCP)* to verify context, provenance, and consent.
- **Responsible Interoperability** – FAIR-style sharing applies only when partners intentionally choose openness.

Together, these create the conditions for distributed, trustworthy reasoning across knowledge domains—allowing insight to move without data leaving safe custody.

---

## DOCUMENT 3: Methods (methods.md)

---
title: "Methods"
description: "How Resonant Knowledge Lab operationalizes ethical data governance and secure reasoning"
---

# Methods

RKL's methods turn ethical governance into practical infrastructure—so organizations can engage advanced reasoning systems with their own data **without losing control or custody**.

We build from the **CARE principles**—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—developed by the [Global Indigenous Data Alliance](https://www.gida-global.org/).
CARE defines how knowledge should be governed; RKL defines **how AI can respect that governance**.
Only when an organization chooses to make outputs discoverable do we apply selected FAIR practices for interoperability.

---

## Modes of Practice

RKL frameworks support a continuum of governance and openness, depending on each organization's objectives and risk posture.

| Type | Description | Governance Focus | Example Use Case | RKL's Role |
|------|--------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Type I – CARE-Focused / Private Reasoning** | Organizations retain full control over their knowledge domains and do **not** expose data externally. AI reasoning occurs internally or through secure local infrastructure. | **CARE-dominant:** internal FAIR practices may support organization-wide discovery, but external sharing is restricted. | **Example:** A regional health authority uses RKL's MCP framework to reason with sensitive patient data locally, producing aggregate insights for policy decisions without transferring any underlying data. | Provide on-premises MCP deployment, secure reasoning environments, and governance templates ensuring authority, auditability, and privacy. |
| **Type II – Open Knowledge Sharing** | Organizations choose to make datasets or narratives publicly accessible and use AI reasoning to enhance understanding and communication. | **FAIR-dominant (with CARE governance):** openness is intentional and ethically managed. | **Example:** The *Ocean Research Project* uses RKL's framework to publish open marine datasets and contextual reasoning results for educators and policymakers. | Provide structured metadata, attribution standards, and responsible reasoning interfaces that preserve provenance and ethical credit. |
| **Type III – CARE-Enabled Insight Exchange** | The transformative case: local control is maintained, but **derived knowledge** is shared externally through secure reasoning interfaces. | **CARE enables exchange:** AI mediates between local governance and collective benefit—producing shared insight without exposing raw data. | **Example:** A coastal community hosts environmental sensors and oral histories locally. RKL's reasoning layer generates anonymized trend summaries for national adaptation planning—sharing insight while raw data remain sovereign. | Design and certify governance-linked reasoning systems. Embed CARE rules in data-derivation pipelines to enable ethical knowledge sharing. |

> **In practice, governance is rarely uniform.**
> Different categories of data, information, or knowledge may operate across multiple modes simultaneously.
> RKL's architecture supports this diversity, linking every mode through a common layer of CARE-based governance and verifiable reasoning control.

---

## Why Secure Reasoning Matters

Most valuable knowledge remains unused—not because it is too sensitive, but because **organizations lack the governance and tools to reason with it safely**.
RKL provides that missing layer: secure reasoning under local authority.
By embedding governance directly into AI interaction, RKL turns protection into participation and makes **trust the core compute resource**.

---

## How the Method Works

### 1. Governance Layer — CARE Rules and Metadata
Defines who controls the data, for what purpose, and under what ethical conditions.
Implemented through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for secure, auditable context exchange.

### 2. Reasoning Layer — Secure Derivation
AI operates inside defined governance boundaries, producing new knowledge or insights without revealing underlying data.
Local or hybrid deployments keep reasoning close to the data source.

### 3. Access Layer — Optional Interoperability
When a partner wishes to share derived insights, RKL supports FAIR-style metadata and attribution so results can circulate responsibly.
FAIR here is **an option, not a goal**.

These layers create the conditions for **Type III—local control with shared understanding**.

---

## Technical Architecture

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** – open protocol for secure AI-context interaction with verifiable governance
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – policy-aware knowledge access ensuring reasoning respects boundaries
- **Vector Databases** – semantic search within governed domains
- **Audit Logging** – transparent provenance and consent tracking
- **Local Deployment Infrastructure** – on-premises and hybrid options ensuring organizational sovereignty

Together these tools ensure reasoning systems respect both the **content** and the **governance** of every knowledge domain.

---

## Ethical and Governance Commitments

Every RKL deployment includes:

- Transparent auditability of reasoning operations
- Reciprocity and attribution built into metadata
- Ethical review checkpoints within technical workflows
- Mechanisms for local veto, consent renewal, and continuous community oversight

Ethical governance is not a constraint—it is what makes reasoning trustworthy.

---
title: "MCP Deployment Guide"
description: "Practical guide to deploying the Model Context Protocol for secure AI reasoning under local control"
---

# MCP Deployment Guide

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is RKL's core technical layer for secure reasoning.
It allows AI systems to interact with organizational knowledge while enforcing **CARE-based governance** at every step.

This guide outlines common deployment models for implementing MCP in practice.

---

## 1. Overview

**Goal:** enable AI reasoning with governed knowledge without transferring control or custody.
MCP provides a verifiable interface between reasoning systems and data, embedding authority, consent, and context into every interaction.

---

## 2. Deployment Models

### **Local Deployment (Preferred)**
- Install MCP within on-premises or institutionally controlled infrastructure.
- Data and embeddings remain local; reasoning occurs inside the firewall.
- Ideal for **Type I** and **Type III** governance modes.

**Benefits:** maximum sovereignty, auditability, and privacy.

---

### **Collaborative Cloud Deployment**
- MCP nodes distributed across trusted research or public-data environments.
- Governance enforced through shared policies and signed metadata.
- Appropriate for open collaborations such as **Type II (Open Knowledge Sharing)** projects like the *Open Ocean Research Project*.

**Benefits:** wider accessibility and collective experimentation under transparent governance.

---

### **Hybrid Deployment**
- Combine local secure reasoning with controlled external synchronization.
- Suitable for gradual transitions between private and public reasoning modes.

---

## 3. Core Components

| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Governance Metadata** | Encodes CARE rules: custodianship, consent, and permitted reasoning operations. |
| **Reasoning Gateway** | Mediates requests between AI agents and governed data; enforces policy. |
| **Audit Log Service** | Tracks every reasoning operation for accountability. |
| **Attribution Module** | Preserves provenance and credit in outputs. |

---

## 4. Security Configuration Checklist

- [ ] Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Require signed governance manifests
- [ ] Configure access-control tokens per domain
- [ ] Activate continuous audit logging
- [ ] Schedule regular governance reviews

---

## 5. Integration with Governance Templates

MCP relies on institutional governance definitions.
See the [Governance Templates](/wiki/governance-templates/) page for ready-to-use policy, consent, and attribution frameworks.

---

## 6. Example Deployment Flow

1. Define governance policies (CARE metadata).
2. Deploy MCP node within secure environment.
3. Register governance metadata with MCP.
4. Connect reasoning agents via authenticated API.
5. Test audit logging and output attribution.
6. (Optional) Publish derived outputs using FAIR-style metadata.

---

## DOCUMENT 6: CARE Implementation Patterns (wiki/care-fair-patterns.md)

---
title: "CARE Implementation Patterns"
description: "Practical patterns for applying CARE principles and enabling secure reasoning under local control"
---

# CARE Implementation Patterns

This section documents practical approaches for implementing **CARE principles**—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—within RKL's secure reasoning framework.

RKL's goal is not to make all data FAIR, but to make all reasoning **accountable and governed**.
FAIR practices may emerge as a by-product when organizations intentionally choose openness, but the foundation is always **CARE-based governance and local control**.

---

## Pattern Overview

| Type | Governance Focus | Description | Example | Objective |
|------|------------------|--------------|----------|------------|
| **Type I – CARE-Focused / Private Reasoning** | Local, closed | AI reasoning occurs entirely within organizational boundaries; no external data exposure. | A regional health department uses RKL's Model Context Protocol (MCP) to analyze patient trends internally, producing policy insights without sharing raw records. | Ensure sensitive knowledge informs decisions safely under full custodial control. |
| **Type II – Open Knowledge Sharing** | Public, open | Organizations share open datasets and allow AI reasoning for transparency and education. | **Open Ocean Research Project (ORP):** RKL's prototype demonstrating AI reasoning with open marine-plastics data, producing interpretable insights while preserving attribution and provenance. | Demonstrate responsible open reasoning that adds interpretability and traceability to public knowledge. |
| **Type III – CARE-Enabled Insight Exchange** | Controlled derivation | Local control with selective sharing of derived insights via secure reasoning interfaces. | A coastal community uses RKL's reasoning layer to publish anonymized trend summaries derived from locally stored cultural and environmental data. | Enable ethical knowledge exchange without exposing underlying data. |

> **Note:** Real-world systems often combine these patterns.
> An organization may use Type I for secure analytics, Type II for public education, and Type III for cooperative reporting—all within one governance framework.

---

## Governance Workflow Examples

1. **Define Authority:** Identify custodians of each dataset or knowledge domain.
2. **Establish Purpose:** Specify allowed reasoning operations (analysis, summarization, simulation).
3. **Encode Governance:** Implement CARE rules through MCP metadata and access policies.
4. **Validate Outputs:** Require audit logs and attribution for any published reasoning.
5. **Optional FAIR Exposure:** If outputs are meant to be shared, apply FAIR-style metadata for discoverability and interoperability.

---

## Technical Architecture Patterns

- **Local Reasoning Nodes** – Deploy reasoning agents adjacent to governed data stores.
- **Policy-Aware RAG** – Retrieval-Augmented Generation that honors governance constraints.
- **Derived Insight Pipelines** – Automated summarization or aggregation under CARE rules.
- **Governance Metadata Registry** – Central index for consent, attribution, and policy data.
