# 2026 RKL Compute Budget Concept Paper

**Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL)** | *Secure reasoning. Local control.* | November 2025

## Purpose

RKL Compute provides the technical foundation for Resonant Knowledge Lab's *Secure Reasoning* mission — enabling advanced AI reasoning on protected, locally governed data without removing that data from local control. This hybrid infrastructure integrates **cloud AI services**, **centrally managed compute**, and **eventual partner-site deployments** to support RKL research, pilot programs, and governance innovation.

## Objectives

1. **Enable Secure Reasoning Pilots** – Safely apply GPT-class models to governed data.
2. **Demonstrate Interoperability** – Connect GPT, Claude, Gemini, and open-source models through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
3. **Provide a Governance Sandbox** – Test consent, traceability, and accountability frameworks.
4. **Establish a Scalable Foundation** – Build capacity for future institutional collaborations and public-interest applications.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Cloud & Subscription Layer

| Service | Description | Est. Annual Cost (USD) |
|:--|:--|--:|
| **OpenAI GPT-Pro / Team** | Primary reasoning & synthesis | 1,000 |
| **Anthropic Claude Pro / Code** | Agentic reasoning & code execution | 900 |
| **Google Gemini Advanced** | Multimodal research & document analysis | 600 |
| **Perplexity Pro (optional)** | Research verification | 400 |
| **Total Annual Subscriptions** | — | **≈ 3,000** |

Accounts will be centrally managed under RKL for authorized research, prototyping, and pilot development.

### 2. Central Compute Layer

A locally governed environment hosting open-source models, retrieval pipelines, and audit systems under the *Secure Reasoning Framework.* The current prototype operates on existing infrastructure and will evolve into a dedicated institutional system as funding permits.

## Pilot Demonstrations (2026)

- **Secure Reasoning Demonstrator** – Comparative reasoning across GPT, Claude, Gemini, and local models using Arctic resilience data.
- **CARE Governance Sandbox** – Testing consent and accountability configurations.
- **Open Ocean Research Project** – Hybrid reasoning on marine and satellite data under local governance.

## Governance & Security

- No ungoverned data leaves local authority.
- All reasoning events are traceable and verifiable under the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
- Commercial AI use follows explicit consent and audit policies.
- Encrypted local storage and reproducible backup workflows ensure compliance and transparency.

## Budget Snapshot (FY 2026)

| Category | Description | Est. USD |
|:--|:--|--:|
| AI Subscriptions | GPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity | 3,000 |
| Central Hardware | Compute / storage / networking upgrades | 8,000 |
| Pilot Deployments | On-prem partner kits | 10,000 |
| Software & Ops | Domains, containers, power & maintenance | 2,000 |
| **Total Estimated** | — | **≈ 23,000 – 25,000** |

## Next Steps

1. Finalize access policies and architecture (Nov–Dec 2025)
2. Secure FY 2026 funding (Dec–Jan)
3. Launch first Secure Reasoning Demonstrator (Spring 2026)

**Resonant Knowledge Lab** — Secure reasoning. Local control.
