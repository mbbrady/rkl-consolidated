# Secure Reasoning Public Briefs

Secure Reasoning Pub-Briefs are the public-facing versions of RKL’s Secure Reasoning Briefs. They summarize recent research in AI safety, alignment, and verifiable AI for:

- Organizations using cloud AI on sensitive data.
- ML engineers and safety practitioners.
- Researchers and policy stakeholders tracking secure reasoning methods.

Each pub-brief is generated from an internal Secure Reasoning Brief (daily or weekly) produced on RKL’s governed infrastructure. Internal briefs never leave RKL systems; only synthesized summaries and public links are published here.

You can browse:

- **Daily pub-briefs** – short snapshots of the most important developments on a given day.
- **Weekly pub-briefs** – higher-level syntheses of trends and top papers across the week.

All pub-briefs are produced under secure reasoning principles, demonstrating how organizations can benefit from AI-assisted analysis without transferring custody or control of their sensitive data.
