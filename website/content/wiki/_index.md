## About This Wiki

This wiki serves as RKL's working notebook—documenting how **secure reasoning** evolves from concept to implementation.
Unlike our polished [Methods page](/methods/), the wiki captures methods currently being tested, implementation patterns, lessons learned, and insights from partners and collaborators across sectors.
