# Governance Templates

Effective governance turns ethical principles into operational reality.
These templates help organizations implement **CARE-aligned, auditable reasoning systems** consistent with RKL's mission of *secure reasoning and local control.*

---

## 1. Data Governance Policy Template

A customizable policy covering:
- Scope of governed knowledge domains
- Custodianship and authority definitions
- Approved reasoning operations
- Audit and reporting requirements
- Alignment with **CARE** principles

---

## 2. Consent & Purpose Frameworks

Templates for managing consent metadata:
- Structured consent manifests for each domain
- Purpose-specific reasoning approvals
- Renewal and revocation mechanisms
- Links to audit and attribution workflows

---

## 3. Access-Control Policies

Define who can invoke reasoning and under what conditions:
- Role-based reasoning permissions
- Time-limited or purpose-bound access tokens
- Local veto and escalation procedures

---

## 4. Audit & Transparency Checklists

Tools to verify accountability:
- Continuous logging of reasoning events
- Automated provenance tracking
- Periodic governance review workflows

---

## 5. Community Engagement Guidelines

Promote responsible collaboration:
- Reciprocity and shared benefit expectations
- Attribution and credit requirements
- Dispute-resolution and ethical feedback processes

---

## 6. Attribution & Licensing Templates

Sample clauses for reasoning outputs:
- Standard attribution statements
- Usage restrictions (educational, non-commercial, etc.)
- Links to custodial organizations and governance manifests

### 6.1 Derived Insight License (Type III)
A license template for **derived outputs** produced by secure reasoning systems:
- **No raw-data exposure:** License grants rights to use **derived insights only**; underlying data remain under custodial control.
- **Attribution required:** Cite the custodians and reasoning environment (MCP node ID / hash).
- **Provenance link:** Include audit log and governance manifest references.
- **Purpose-bound use:** Limit downstream use to approved purposes; require re-consent for new uses.
- **Revocation:** Custodian may revoke rights if governance terms are breached.

---

## 7. Example Integration with MCP

Each template can be encoded as metadata and registered through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for enforcement.
For setup steps, see the **[MCP Deployment Guide](/wiki/mcp-deployment)**.

---

## 8. Building a Governance Portfolio

Compose a comprehensive governance portfolio:
1. Start with the **Data Governance Policy**
2. Add **Consent** and **Access Control** layers
3. Integrate **Attribution** and **Audit** frameworks
4. Test via a pilot reasoning deployment
