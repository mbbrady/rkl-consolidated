title: "Focus Areas"
description: "How RKL translates secure reasoning into practice"
---

RKL develops and tests **secure reasoning**—a framework that embeds governance, consent, and accountability directly into the reasoning process of AI.
Our **focus areas** turn that framework into practice, showing how ethical governance and open infrastructure can work together to build trust in AI.

Each area represents a line of applied inquiry rather than a fixed program.
We work collaboratively through small, transparent demonstrations that model how secure reasoning supports public missions while keeping knowledge under local control.

---

## Our Approach

Grounded in the **CARE Principles**—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—RKL builds **governed reasoning infrastructure** that allows organizations to use AI responsibly, verifiably, and under their own governance.

Our projects operate across three complementary modes:

- **Type I (CARE-Focused)** — Secure reasoning within local systems
- **Type II (Open Knowledge Sharing)** — Responsible open reasoning when openness is chosen
- **Type III (CARE-Enabled Insight Exchange)** — Sharing derived insights without exposing raw data

For technical details, see [Methods](/methods).

## Core Focus Areas

### 1. Open Protocols for Secure Reasoning {#open-protocols}

We advance **public-interest protocols** that make governance verifiable and interoperable across AI systems.

**Focus:** Implement and refine open standards such as the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to define how reasoning systems interact securely with governed knowledge domains.

**Key Work**
- Apply MCP to real-world deployments
- Develop policy-aware retrieval and audit protocols
- Contribute to open standards and documentation

**Outcomes**
- Reference architectures and implementation guides
- Protocol extensions for domain-specific governance
- Integration resources for developers and custodians

---

### 2. Reference Implementations & Toolkits {#implementations}

We build and publish **open-source stacks, adapters, and audit tools** that demonstrate how secure reasoning operates under local control.

**Key Work**
- Develop MCP service nodes for common deployment scenarios
- Create reproducible environments for on-premise and hybrid use
- Maintain transparent documentation and templates

**Outcomes**
- Secure Reasoning Reference Stack (MCP + policy-aware retrieval)
- Deployment templates (Docker/Kubernetes)
- Governance-linked audit and compliance tooling

RKL maintains independent computational resources to ensure **reproducible, verifiable research** free from commercial dependency. See our [Methods Wiki](/wiki) for implementation details.

---

### 3. Knowledge Access & Decision Support Pilots {#pilots}

We collaborate with partners to design and test **real-world reasoning environments** that operate within governance boundaries.

**Examples**
- **Healthcare:** Internal reasoning over patient data and research literature without PHI exposure
- **Public Administration:** Context-aware planning tools using governed archival data
- **Cultural Heritage:** Role-based reasoning within consent-governed archives
- **Education & Research:** Provenance-linked reasoning over distributed repositories
- **Environmental Management:** Federated reasoning across local and scientific datasets

**Outcomes**
- Field-pilot configurations and validation reports
- Lessons learned and reproducibility templates
- Governance and performance benchmarks

---

### 4. Governance & Stewardship Frameworks {#governance}

We design and publish **governance templates** that make secure reasoning practical and trustworthy.
These frameworks operationalize CARE values and turn ethical commitments into verifiable practice.

**Outcomes**
- AI Governance Starter Kit (CARE-aligned templates)
- Consent, licensing, and access-control examples
- Compliance and transparency checklists

---

### 5. Research & Applied Inquiry {#research}

We study how secure reasoning reshapes **human–AI collaboration, institutional accountability, and collective intelligence**.

**Topics**
- Reasoning within governed contexts
- Human oversight and interpretability
- Ethical design and institutional adoption

**Outcomes**
- Applied studies and working papers
- Shared metrics for trust and accountability
- Insights that guide technical and governance evolution

---

### 6. Education & Public Engagement {#education}

We build capacity for **ethical AI and knowledge governance** through education, training, and community engagement.

**Key Work**
- Workshops on MCP, governance design, and audit practices
- Practitioner training and knowledge-readiness curricula
- Public lectures and community dialogues

**Outcomes**
- Training modules and online resources
- Open workshop materials and case studies
- A growing community of practice

---

## Year 1 Operational Focus (2025–2026)

1. **Secure Reasoning Reference Stack (MCP + policy-aware retrieval)** — Demonstrate "trust through protocol."
2. **Field Pilot (Single Partner)** — Validate governance and technical architecture.
3. **Governance Toolkit v1** — Publish open templates for consent, licensing, and policy control.

## Illustrative Sector Applications

| Sector | Challenge | RKL Approach | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Healthcare** | Reasoning with sensitive data without PHI exposure | MCP gateway + governed retrieval + local auditing | Verified reasoning across patient data and literature; **zero data egress** |
| **Public Administration** | Use institutional knowledge without breaching confidentiality | Policy-aware retrieval + governance manifests | Faster, auditable policy decisions |
| **Cultural Heritage** | Enable role-based access with consent governance | CARE-aligned reasoning workflows | Data sovereignty preserved; shared cultural insight |
| **Education** | Maintain accuracy and provenance in teaching/research | Context brokers linking repositories and reasoning systems | Up-to-date, traceable learning resources |
| **Environment** | Integrate distributed ecological data responsibly | Federated reasoning under shared governance | Evidence-based decisions that respect local stewardship |
