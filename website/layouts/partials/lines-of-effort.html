      Resonant Knowledge Lab connects ethical governance, secure reasoning, and applied systems development.
      We are <strong>actively advancing</strong> our core focus areas while
      exploring new collaborations that strengthen trusted, locally governed AI infrastructure.

          <h4>Open Protocols</h4>
          <p>
            Apply and refine public-interest protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for secure AI–knowledge reasoning.
            We help define how reasoning systems can interact securely and verifiably with governed knowledge domains—ensuring privacy, provenance, and organizational control.

          <h4>Reference Toolkits</h4>
          <p>
            Build open-source adapters, audit logging, and reproducible on-premises stacks organizations can deploy.
            Our reference implementations demonstrate practical examples of secure AI integration that others can adapt, deploy, and audit — supporting verifiable reasoning under local control.

          <h4>Field Pilots</h4>
          <p>
            Partner with organizations to deploy real-world systems that bridge research and institutional knowledge.
            Through applied pilots we validate practical, governed reasoning in real-world contexts.

            Publish consent, data licensing, and access-control templates.
            We're developing governance tools grounded in the CARE principles that help organizations define who can access what knowledge, under which conditions, and with what oversight.

          <p>
            Study how human–machine reasoning can responsibly contribute to knowledge creation.
            Through partnerships, we examine how governed reasoning enhances learning and decision-making.
