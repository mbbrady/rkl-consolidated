# RKL About Page - For GPT-5 Review

This document shows the current About page content for white paper alignment.

---

## CONTEXT

The About page is Phase 1, Priority 2 in the website update project (after the homepage).

**Goal:** Align the About page with the white paper while maintaining professional, pithy, clean tone.

**What to review:**
- Vision and Mission statements - ensure alignment with white paper
- Guiding Principles - check if they match white paper framing
- All language should be accessible to general readers
- Keep structure and key elements (CARE, three-mode framework, etc.)

title: "About RKL"
Description: "Resonant Knowledge Lab — Mission and Vision"
---

**Resonant Knowledge Lab (RKL)** is a nonprofit research and implementation organization building **open protocols** and **verifiable methods** that let people and institutions engage AI reasoning systems with their own knowledge — **without transferring control or custody**.

---

## Vision

We envision a world where knowledge flows **securely and ethically**: data remain under the care of those who steward them, while **derived insights** can travel for collective benefit.

Much of the world's most valuable knowledge is silent — not because it is too sensitive, but because organizations lack the **governance capacity** to use it safely. **Weak governance, not sensitivity itself, keeps knowledge locked away.**

RKL's frameworks strengthen that governance, turning protection into participation and silos into resonance. By embedding ethical rules directly into data and reasoning systems, RKL makes **trust the medium of discovery**.

---

## Mission

To develop **open, verifiable frameworks** that enable people and institutions to use advanced reasoning systems — **responsibly, transparently, and under their own control**.

RKL's work bridges technical interoperability with ethical governance so that reasoning systems respect the rights, dignity, and contexts of the knowledge they use.

---

## Guiding Principles

These principles translate RKL's philosophy into system design choices, expressing how **CARE governs secure reasoning** in practice:

- **Context Over Content** — Reasoning systems engage through controlled context, not raw data transfer.
- **Governance by Design** — Ethical authority and consent are built into the architecture itself.
- **Verification Over Assumption** — Provenance, privacy, and consent must be provable, not implied.
- **Protocols Over Platforms** — The trust layer of AI must remain open, inspectable, and non-proprietary.
- **Resonance Through Responsible Reuse** — Knowledge gains value when it can be ethically rediscovered and applied under local governance.

---

## Modes of Practice

RKL supports three complementary modes of secure reasoning and stewardship:

| Type | Mode | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **I. CARE-Focused** | Secure reasoning within local systems. | Protect and govern sensitive knowledge. |
| **II. Open Knowledge Sharing** | Public or collaborative knowledge with ethical guardrails. | Communicate and collaborate transparently when openness is intentionally chosen. |
| **III. CARE-Enabled Insight Exchange** | Derived insight sharing without exposing raw data. | Unlock trustworthy knowledge across boundaries. |

Type III represents RKL's north star — **a world where local control and global understanding coexist.**

> In practice, most organizations span more than one mode. RKL's frameworks accommodate this mix — allowing each domain to be governed according to its own objectives while remaining interoperable through shared ethical and technical standards.

For technical details, see [Methods](/methods).

---

## Approach

RKL's frameworks combine:

- **Ethical Governance** — **CARE principles** (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) guide every decision.
- **Secure Reasoning Infrastructure** — Implemented through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to verify context, provenance, and consent.
- **Responsible Interoperability** — When organizations choose openness, structured metadata and attribution enable ethical knowledge sharing.

Together, these create conditions for distributed, trustworthy reasoning — letting insight move while data remain in safe custody.

---

## Organization

Established in 2025 as a Virginia-based **501(c)(3)** nonprofit research and implementation organization, **Resonant Knowledge Lab** provides the public-interest infrastructure layer for responsible AI–knowledge interaction. We work with communities, organizations, and researchers to build practical systems that respect data sovereignty, enable knowledge access, and maintain transparent governance.

**Contact:** [info@resonantknowledgelab.org](mailto:info@resonantknowledgelab.org)
**Website:** resonantknowledgelab.org

---

RKL's work begins where ethics meet infrastructure — **Secure reasoning. Local control.**
```

## STRUCTURE TO PRESERVE

The About page has 7 main sections:
1. **Opening statement** - Brief intro to RKL
2. **Vision** - Long-term aspirational view
3. **Mission** - What RKL does and why
4. **Guiding Principles** - 5 design principles (bulleted list)
5. **Modes of Practice** - Three-mode framework (table + explanatory text)
6. **Approach** - How CARE, MCP, and interoperability work together
7. **Organization** - 501(c)(3) details and contact info

**Keep this structure** - GPT-5 should review/tighten the content within each section.

---

## WHAT NEEDS REVIEW

**Priority areas:**
1. **Vision section** - Is this aligned with white paper's vision?
2. **Mission section** - Does this match white paper's mission statement?
3. **Guiding Principles** - Do these 5 principles match white paper framing?
4. **Overall tone** - Is everything accessible, professional, pithy?

**What to preserve:**
- Three-mode framework (Type I, II, III) - this is core to RKL
- CARE principles mention
- MCP as technical implementation
- 501(c)(3) status and contact info
- Table format for Modes of Practice

---

## FOR GPT-5: REQUESTED OUTPUT

Please review the About page content and provide:

1. **Section-by-section edits** in markdown format
2. **Rationale** for each significant change (how it aligns with white paper)
3. **Word count** for each section (keep tight)
4. **Flag any departures** from current content that need discussion

**Tone requirements:**
- Professional, pithy, and clean
- Accessible to general readers (not just technical experts)
- Faithful to white paper's ethical and technical framing
- Plain, inviting language for public audiences

**Output format:**
Provide the complete updated markdown content for `about.md` that can be directly copied into the file.

## NOTES

- The opening statement before the first ## heading is the intro paragraph
- The three-mode framework is central to RKL's approach - preserve this
- The table structure for Modes of Practice should be kept
- Cross-references to other pages ([Methods](/methods)) should be preserved
- Closing tagline can be kept or updated if there's a better option
